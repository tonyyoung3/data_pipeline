The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.

The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.

To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.

The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on cutting-edge research projects.

The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.

To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.

A candidate who is selected for an internship with an organization will receive an offer letter after the organization has completed its second-round interviews.

Introduction

Begin your Diving career and travel the world by earning your PADI Divemaster qualification with us. First, you will journey to the tiny Fijian island of Caqalai to start your theoretical and practical training. Here you will also earn your PADI Coral Reef Researcher Speciality, exclusive to our marine conservation programs. This will allow you to assist the permanent team stationed on the island with long-term locally led ocean conservation efforts aligned to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #14, Life Below Water.

Afterwards you will join a dive centre in Thailand as a junior staff member (student intern) for 3 months, where you will perfect your skills as a recreational dive leader. The internship is designed to give you an intensive and comprehensive introduction to professional diving with the opportunity to experience two of the worlds most popular diving locations.

Daily Life



Marine conservation interns will be trained in the identification of invertebrate, fish or benthic (coral) target species and life forms. Once fully trained in species ID, volunteers will be taught several survey techniques allowing them to become a member of the data collection survey team building an inventory of marine species in Moturiki waters.

Once Interns are making progress on their science training they will get the chance to work on important community projects in local villages working to improve water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the opportunity to teach children about environmental conservation during rotating weekly school visits on Moturiki Island.

Marine Conservation interns will be spending time getting to know the local community and their traditional villages.

The interns will spend 3 months on the marine conservation expedition gaining their PADI Open Water, Advanced Open Water, Rescue Diver, Emergency First Responder and Coral Reef Research Diver certifications , complete the Leadership Training Course and internship assignments followed . Weekly assignments must be completed and there will be weekly 1-on-1 meetings with a staff mentor

Once you have successfully completed the first three months of training in Fiji, you will travel to a dive centre in Southern Thailand.

Here you will learn what the business of running diving tours is really like, under the guidance of a professional diving team.

Gain experience working with clients by leading a dive in preparation for your final PADI Divemaster assessment.

Survey Training: The best way for you to improve and assess participants fish, invertebrate and benthic life-form knowledge, is to use a variety of teaching methods. In Caqalai, this incorporates slideshow presentations, fun workshops (fish bingo anyone?) and most importantly, what we call spot dives +amp; snorkels. Once basic dive training is completed at the beginning of the expedition, each diving day you will participate in one to two spot dives or snorkels.

Introduction

South Africa is home to several species under threat, like the critically endangered black rhinoceros and near threatened white rhinoceros. Our international conservation team in Karongwe private nature reserve, only an hour from Kruger National Park, works toward conserving the species found in the protected area by partnering with local and international organisations like the South African National, SAN Parks authority and the Endangered Wildlife Trust.

This program gives volunteers the opportunity to learn about the global issue of poaching and how international and South African organisations are working on prevention. The focus specifically concerns the poaching of rhinoceros. Volunteers will attend lectures on the topic of poaching, the impact of losing important animals on the ecosystem, how anti-poaching efforts are set up and run which will be presented by a SAN Parks representative, and how fundraising initiatives are set up and run, as well as delivering environmental education workshops in the local community.

Daily Life

You will work closely with our Internship co-ordinator and attend anti-poaching awareness lectures. You will also assist with fundraising projects for rhino conservation.

It is important to note that you won't take part in anti-poaching patrols due to the dangerous nature of the activity. You should expect to get involved in other conservation activities, like the monitoring of predators, assisting with habitat rehabilitation in the local area, and conservation awareness at local schools.

Most weekdays will be spent going on a safari conservation drive through the protected are. Each volunteer is assigned to specific duty on each drive. This might include using the telemetry equipment to track lions, cheetahs, and other predators, capturing the data noted on the drive, navigating through the reserve, or checking and tidying the vehicle.

You will head out on 1-2 drives a day, master radio telemetry techniques and learn to track animals through the bush; get acquainted with big game and all the main predators, including lion, cheetah, leopard, elephant and rhino.

The Galapagos Islands are one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, home to one-of-a-kind species such as Galapagos penguins and giant tortoises. While there are many local and international efforts to protect the Galapagos and its inhabitants (including native peoples), the islands suffer many challenges, such as a lack of food security, a reliance on imports, invasive species consuming local resources, and a lack of seed-saving practices for native species. This internship is an opportunity to collaborate with a farm that has been researching how to achieve autonomous, resilient, chemical-free, regenerative, and profitable agriculture in the Galapagos islands. The farm is also an agro-ecology school and arguably the founder of the first local seed bank (of edible species) in the Galapagos.

Daily Life

At the start of your program, you will have an orientation on the island of Santa Cruz where the farm and your host family are also located. During orientation workshops, you will start learning about the culture, people, and geography of the region as well as other tools to support you in your internship abroad.

In addition to your collaboration at the farm, you will be able to participate in the daily lives of your host family members, forming meaningful connections with them and exchanging knowledge. You may even have the chance to participate in local customs and traditions during your stay.

At the farm, interns will be able to learn about the reality of the Galapagos Islands, participate in daily customs and rituals, and experience the culture of the community on the island of Santa Cruz. Interns are expected to work about 4-5 hours per day, 5 days per week, and regularly assist with the daily maintenance of the main house and the gardens. Interns are free to visit the island in the afternoon and go exploring on the weekends.


Your main internship can be combined with personal research. We can connect you with our network of experts to create an independent project researching a topic of your interest that relates to agriculture, sustainability, conservation, etc.

This project is with a surfing-inspired sustainable development non-profit (NGO) driving the development of poor Peruvian coastal communities through a path of sustainability. We develop environmental, educational, infrastructure and socio-economic projects working hand in hand with local communities and international interns.



As a multidisciplinary academic team, we not only carry out our own social and scientific projects that we constantly need support with, but we also welcome interns from universities around the world to come and carry out their own bachelors/masters/PhD research with us in Lobitos. Volunteer interns are welcomed to develop their own research project as part of their application if it can be aligned with our work and focus.

Daily Life



As a research volunteer intern, you will be given ownership of the research projects, working alongside members of the community and the team. The daily activities will vary depending on whether you are conducting your own research or supporting us with a current project.

This research project aims to quantify the impact that we have on the local community in relation to the UNs Sustainable Development Goals. Interns are needed to help conceptualise the methodology and carry out data collection via surveys with members of the local community.

As a surfing paradise with world-class waves, Lobitos attracts beginner to advanced surfers from all over the world. As a result, the tourism industry is growing rapidly and will need to be effectively managed in the future. As a result, Surfonomics studies work to determine the economic value of waves to coastal communities, so that these communities can make beneficial, informed decisions regarding coastal protection. Analyzing this data will allow us and our affiliates to put a quantitative value to the waves of Lobitos, which will better enable their protection and potentially have Lobitos be declared a World Surfing Reserve. Volunteer interns may be required to carry out data analysis using SPSS statistical software and report writing based on surveys conducted with tourists and surfers in 2018/2019.

After winning a research grant from the Royal Academy of Engineering-UK (RAEng) by the UKs Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), we have been conducting groundwater research in Lobitos in partnership with UK universities. This study aims to investigate the extent +amp; quality of groundwater resources in the region that could potentially be sustainably tapped into, managed and used for reforestation irrigation or potentially human consumption by local communities. Interns are needed to support the team in fieldwork, community workshops, analysis of qualitative and quantitative data that has been collected and report writing.

Project 1

Developing a business plan for bird watching ecotourism in the equatorial dry forest, one of the most endangered forests in the world. The long-term goal is to provide an economic alternative to illegal logging of a poor settlement located in our zone of influence. The students would develop a business plan alongside the local community who are striving for greater equality and therefore lead the reforestation projects. This project will have a huge impact on the lives of the locals, the species that will be saved in preserving the forest and will help mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Project 2

Provide entrepreneurial and creative knowledge to local farmers running small farms and cheese production businesses. Volunteer interns will assist locals to consolidate ideas and create a business plan.

Project 3

Conduct market research into how local fisherman can increase the productivity of their catch. Local fishermen use lines and nets so they dont harm the environment but are at threat from trawlers and illegal fishing.

Create an appropriate research methodology for your own academic research as a part of your university studies which would be applicable to Lobitos and the work that we do. We have received many interns from various world class universities who have carried out successful socio-economic and scientific fieldwork projects as part of their degrees with us.

Depending on the nature of your research, you may be required to bring certain equipment and resources to aid in data collection.

Amazon Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a mission driven business, combining Amazon’s fulfillment scale and world-leading technology to enable sellers to grow and thrive on Amazon’s Marketplaces. Sellers, from Fortune 50 companies to hundreds of thousands of small businesses and entrepreneurs, in 135 countries worldwide, sold more items in 2018 - more than Amazon’s own Retail business. Plus, more than 20,000 of them surpassed $1MM in sales and they created 900,000 jobs around the world. When sellers use Fulfillment By Amazon or Seller Fulfilled Prime, they also add Amazon’s Prime shipping speeds and customer trust to this reach and scale. As Jeff Bezos’ put it, FBA “is so important because it is the glue that inextricably links Marketplace and Prime…”

Our development team creates the interfaces and automation that allow thousands of sellers world-wide to run their businesses with Amazon’s world-class fulfillment systems. With this innovative service, sellers send inventory directly to Amazon where it is stored and managed in our secure facilities. When orders are received, Amazon will professionally pick, pack and ship the product directly to their customers. As a result, FBA sellers can offer their customers fantastic benefits such as Prime, Super Saver Shipping and 24/7 Amazon customer service. We need your help to grow the business by building highly-available, scalable distributed systems that provide clean interfaces between sellers, customers and Amazon's supply chain software.

We are using machine learning to help us identify potentially time wasting or costly defects in supply chains and inventory management, getting items available for sale as efficiently and quickly as possible while reducing returns.

We recruit across all business functions and seniorities and thrive in the most competitive hiring market there is - technology.

The Role

Your job is to help us gain traction with the candidate side of the Hirefully equation. You’re a good fit if you’re...

A Blend of EQ and IQ. You’ll be evangelizing our approach and explaining our proposition to super smart people that want to manage their careers and job hunting.

Summer Business Analyst Intern

We are excited to invite you to apply to the Kearney Diversity Consulting Boot Camp on September 29, 2023 ! The Kearney Diversity Consulting Boot Camp aims to provide current students of Black, Latino/Hispanic, Native American, and Indigenous backgrounds with an in-person opportunity to learn about the firm, network with Kearney consultants, and participate in practice case interviews.



This will be an in-person one-day program hosted by current Kearney consultants in our Chicago office that will include a firm overview, case workshops, and group case practice as well as networking opportunities with consultants at Kearney! If you are invited, travel, lodging, and meals will be provided. Please note that an invitation to attend our boot camp is also an invitation to interview for our 2024 summer internship program for a position as a Summer Business Analyst Intern.





As a global consulting partnership in more than 40 countries, our people make us who we are. We’re individuals with different passions and strengths who take as much joy in the work we do as from those we work with. Over the years we’ve fostered a culture in which we are united by shared values—passion, solidarity, generosity, curiosity and boldness—and these come alive in the work we do and how we do it.

Together, we know our people are our difference—for our clients, our colleagues, and our communities. That’s why we take pride in being individual and inclusive and create a place where everyone can bring their full self to work.







. Collaborating with our clients across a range of industries and service practices, our people are always learning. At Kearney, you will broaden your knowledge and experience across a breadth of areas, no matter your role.

Through both, our structured programs and apprenticeship model, you will continue to learn and develop every day. After all, we are here to help you not just perform, but to thrive in your career.

. At Kearney, we give you the freedom to contribute creatively while you also pursue your dreams. We want you to bring your whole self to work and to find joy in what you do. That’s why we support our people when they want to let their uniqueness show and offer personalized opportunities including tuition support, flexible work programs, and externships.





If you're reading this, you're smart enough to already know what we’re looking for. Insightful, yes. Inquisitive, naturally. Collaborative, of course. But we’re also looking for problem-solvers who think further than that, who don't accept the first thing in front of them, and who are always unapologetically themselves.



This business is fundamentally about making connections—between facts, figures, insights, strategies, tools, technologies and above all, people.



You are eligible for the three practices below. During your application you will have the option to pick your ranking of the practices below. This application is not eligible for our Digital Transformation practice and if ranked will not be considered.

Generalist role with no practice alignment. The BA role is our entry level consulting position and will work across industries and functions without specializing. All consultants are expected to specialize by the senior associate/manager level.

If you want to see the difference you make to the well-being and lives of clients on a daily basis, while changing the face of healthcare and rehabilitation, Altum Health is your next step.


Psychological staff pursuing Supervised practice with focus in Neuropsychology, clinical psychology or fully autonomous Neuro/Clinical Psychologists, work at Altum Health with clients who have a range of mental health and/or substance issues, some with musculoskeletal injuries, concussions and other concurrent conditions.

At Altum, you have the opportunity to work side-by-side with a rehabilitation team of psychotherapists, psychiatrists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, chiropractors, kinesiologists and surgeons.

There are difficult cases that challenge you and there are sensitive cases that require a delicate touch. Every day there are clinical learning opportunities and teaching moments. With the Circle of Care mindset as a guiding principle, you eagerly participate in quality improvement activities and perform cross-functional and cross-site duties as required. You believe in the work we do together.










At Altum Health we are experts in full-scope healthcare services including rehabilitation. We started off with very humble beginnings as a one-room assessment centre, partnered with WSIB. We have since grown into a 300+ person organization with a broad demographic of patients and a diverse client base.

Altum Health is a private-for-public department of UHN; every dollar we make goes back to fund public healthcare initiatives. Our ongoing focus is to maintain a high degree of credibility in our field, to be leaders in healthcare and to change the rehabilitation model of care through the discovery of new approaches. With patient safety and quality care at the top of our priority list, we continue to build upon a culture of discovery and adventure.

Altum Health wants to invite you to join us on our ongoing journey of firsts as we pioneer change and raise the bar in healthcare.

If you share our beliefs, are invested in bettering the lives of patients on a daily and long-term basis and you want to be a pioneer in rehabilitative care, join Altum Health as we continue to break new ground, build relationships and give back to our communities.

Be the face of change and the hands that heal.
