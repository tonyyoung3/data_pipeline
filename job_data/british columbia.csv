Introduction

South Africa is home to several species under threat, like the critically endangered black rhinoceros and near threatened white rhinoceros. Our international conservation team in Karongwe private nature reserve, only an hour from Kruger National Park, works toward conserving the species found in the protected area by partnering with local and international organisations like the South African National, SAN Parks authority and the Endangered Wildlife Trust.

This program gives volunteers the opportunity to learn about the global issue of poaching and how international and South African organisations are working on prevention. The focus specifically concerns the poaching of rhinoceros. Volunteers will attend lectures on the topic of poaching, the impact of losing important animals on the ecosystem, how anti-poaching efforts are set up and run which will be presented by a SAN Parks representative, and how fundraising initiatives are set up and run, as well as delivering environmental education workshops in the local community.

Daily Life

You will work closely with our Internship co-ordinator and attend anti-poaching awareness lectures. You will also assist with fundraising projects for rhino conservation.

It is important to note that you won't take part in anti-poaching patrols due to the dangerous nature of the activity. You should expect to get involved in other conservation activities, like the monitoring of predators, assisting with habitat rehabilitation in the local area, and conservation awareness at local schools.

Most weekdays will be spent going on a safari conservation drive through the protected are. Each volunteer is assigned to specific duty on each drive. This might include using the telemetry equipment to track lions, cheetahs, and other predators, capturing the data noted on the drive, navigating through the reserve, or checking and tidying the vehicle.

You will head out on 1-2 drives a day, master radio telemetry techniques and learn to track animals through the bush; get acquainted with big game and all the main predators, including lion, cheetah, leopard, elephant and rhino.

Start Dates:Project is on-going, and you can join at any time, depending upon availability

: from $1180 USD for the first 2weeks+ from $423 for each week thereafter

Fee Includes: all food, accommodation, pre-departure + in-country support, orientation and all project related activities

Does not Include: flights, airport pickup, travel insurance, personal spending, visas and vaccinations

This opportunity is designed to give you the contacts and experience to help further your career. You are not replacing any member of staff, but helping alongside them, whilst learning new skills.



This project is with a surfing-inspired sustainable development non-profit (NGO) driving the development of poor Peruvian coastal communities through a path of sustainability. We develop environmental, educational, infrastructure and socio-economic projects working hand in hand with local communities and international interns.



As a multidisciplinary academic team, we not only carry out our own social and scientific projects that we constantly need support with, but we also welcome interns from universities around the world to come and carry out their own bachelors/masters/PhD research with us in Lobitos. Volunteer interns are welcomed to develop their own research project as part of their application if it can be aligned with our work and focus.

Daily Life



As a research volunteer intern, you will be given ownership of the research projects, working alongside members of the community and the team. The daily activities will vary depending on whether you are conducting your own research or supporting us with a current project.

This research project aims to quantify the impact that we have on the local community in relation to the UNs Sustainable Development Goals. Interns are needed to help conceptualise the methodology and carry out data collection via surveys with members of the local community.

As a surfing paradise with world-class waves, Lobitos attracts beginner to advanced surfers from all over the world. As a result, the tourism industry is growing rapidly and will need to be effectively managed in the future. As a result, Surfonomics studies work to determine the economic value of waves to coastal communities, so that these communities can make beneficial, informed decisions regarding coastal protection. Analyzing this data will allow us and our affiliates to put a quantitative value to the waves of Lobitos, which will better enable their protection and potentially have Lobitos be declared a World Surfing Reserve. Volunteer interns may be required to carry out data analysis using SPSS statistical software and report writing based on surveys conducted with tourists and surfers in 2018/2019.

After winning a research grant from the Royal Academy of Engineering-UK (RAEng) by the UKs Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), we have been conducting groundwater research in Lobitos in partnership with UK universities. This study aims to investigate the extent +amp; quality of groundwater resources in the region that could potentially be sustainably tapped into, managed and used for reforestation irrigation or potentially human consumption by local communities. Interns are needed to support the team in fieldwork, community workshops, analysis of qualitative and quantitative data that has been collected and report writing.

Project 1

Developing a business plan for bird watching ecotourism in the equatorial dry forest, one of the most endangered forests in the world. The long-term goal is to provide an economic alternative to illegal logging of a poor settlement located in our zone of influence. The students would develop a business plan alongside the local community who are striving for greater equality and therefore lead the reforestation projects. This project will have a huge impact on the lives of the locals, the species that will be saved in preserving the forest and will help mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Project 2

Provide entrepreneurial and creative knowledge to local farmers running small farms and cheese production businesses. Volunteer interns will assist locals to consolidate ideas and create a business plan.

Project 3

Conduct market research into how local fisherman can increase the productivity of their catch. Local fishermen use lines and nets so they dont harm the environment but are at threat from trawlers and illegal fishing.

Create an appropriate research methodology for your own academic research as a part of your university studies which would be applicable to Lobitos and the work that we do. We have received many interns from various world class universities who have carried out successful socio-economic and scientific fieldwork projects as part of their degrees with us.

Depending on the nature of your research, you may be required to bring certain equipment and resources to aid in data collection.

Reconciliation is an ongoing process and a shared responsibility for all of us.

True reconciliation will take time and ongoing commitment to work with Indigenous Peoples as they move toward self-determination. Guiding these efforts Crown agencies must remain focused on creating opportunities that implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Mandate.
